# README #
Hello, thanks for showing interest in my first Unreal Engine game. However, the project files and the HTML game are much too large for GitHub and BitBucket so instead I put a link for the downloads.
HTML: Download the folder and launch the Unreal Server starter and you can play it.
Project: Load the project into Unreal Engine to edit it.

If you want to play the game here are the controls:
-Click Play to start the game
-The game will end once your HEALTH reaches 0. However, health does regenerate. You also have shields which can be increased using pickups.

-WASD and Spacebar for regular controls
-R to reload
-1 and 2 to switch weapons
-G for gernades
-Right-click for ADS
-Left-click to shoot
-Shift to run (Does not work on HTML version)
-Ctrl for crouch (Does not work on HTML version)

The idea of the game is to kill as many zombies waves as possible, indicated by the level. Throughout the map there are pick ups like scopes, gun attatchments, shield boosters and an extra gun.
Have fun!

Just a note, all the assets for the game are not mine. Only the code and the blueprints are. If you want to use the blueprints and the code just ask me in advance.
